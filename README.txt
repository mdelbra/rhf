Introduction
-----------
RHF is a multi-scale filter that accelerates Monte Carlo renderers.  
Each pixel in the image is characterized by the colors of the rays
that reach its surface. The RHF algorithm uses a statistical 
distance to compare with each other the ray color distributions 
associated with different pixels, at each scale. Based on this 
distance, it decides whether two pixels can share their rays or not.

Requirements
------------
- OpenEXR for reading EXR images


Compilation
-----------
Simply use the provided makefile, with the command `make`. You need to set
the directory where the libraries: openEXR have the respective
header and libraries files.

In case OpenMP is available, you can compile with OpenMP 
support with the command `make OMP=1`.

Running
-------

Usage: ./rhf [options] <input file> <output file>
Only EXR images are supported.

Options:
   -h <hist>   The filename with the histogram
   -d <float>  Max-distance between patchs
   -k <int>    Minimum number of similar patchs (default: 2)
   -b <int>    Half the block size  (default: 6)
   -w <int>    Half the windows size (default: 1)
   -s <int>    Number of Scales - Multi-Scale (default: 2)


A running Example

./rhf toasters_00256.exr -h toasters_00256_hist.exr -d 0.8 toasters_filt.exr
